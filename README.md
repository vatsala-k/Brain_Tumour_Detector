# Brain_Tumour_Detector
This project adopts a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and advanced architectures like VGG16 and EfficientNetB0 to address the challenges of multi-class brain tumour detection. The methodology is evaluated on MRI datasets, with enhancements aimed at improving overall accuracy and reliability.
